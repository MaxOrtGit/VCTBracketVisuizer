# VCTBracketVisuizer
This program uses java to pull Valorant Esports Matches and Teams from the liquidpedia API. It then takes them and automatically organizes them into a map of how heach region gets teams to the finals. This Project took me like 6 months to make with figuring out the liquidpedia API, trying to automatically orgranizs 100s of differnt matches with differnt standaeds for differnt regions, and using JGraph to display the bracket. It is currently in a working state but adding the last features isnt currently in the scope, ive learned enough about APIs, JGraph, and fixing edge cases. This program works as of September 20th 2021.
